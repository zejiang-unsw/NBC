# NBC
 Nested Bias Correction
 
 Note: This is a simplified R package based on [MBC](http://www.hydrology.unsw.edu.au/multivariate-bias-correction-mbc) developed at WRC, UNSW. The NBC package development is still on-going. 

## Installation
You can install the package via devtools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zejiang-unsw/NBC")
```
